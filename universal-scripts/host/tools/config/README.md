# Board Flashing Configuration on RZ devices

All the scripts uses a `boards_flash_config.toml` file to define flash layout and bootloader addresses for supported boards. The configuration is structured per board and boot type (e.g., qspi, emmc), and includes information such as:

- BL2, FIP, BID flash offsets
- Ethernet addresses
- Common load_address per board

## Example Structure

```toml
[rzg2l-sbc.qspi]
BL2 = ["11E00", "00000"]
FIP = ["00000", "1D200"]
BID = ["00810", "1C700"]

[rzg2l-sbc.emmc]
BL2 = ["1", "1", "11E00"]
FIP = ["1", "100", "00000", "2", "8"]
BID = ["1", "200", "1C700", "250", "122"]

[rzg2l-sbc]
ethernet = ["11c20000", "11c30000"]
flash_address = ["00000", "1D200", "1C700"]
load_address = "0x48000000"
```

## How to support new board to script

Edit the `boards_flash_config.toml` file to include the new board information:

```toml
[<board_name>]
ethernet = ["<eth0_address>", "eth1_address"]
flash_address = ["<bl2>", "<fip>", "<board_information>"],
load_address = "<working_ram>"

[<board_name>.qspi]
"BL2": ["<srec_top_address>", "<flash_address>"]
"FIP": ["<srec_top_address>", "<flash_address>"]
"BID": ["<binary_size (.bin) / srec_top_address (.srec)>", "<flash_address>"]

[<board_name>.emmc]
"BL2": ["<area>", "<sector_start>", "<program_start_address>"]
"FIP": ["<area>", "<sector_start>", "<program_start_address>", "<ext_csd_b1>", "<ext_csd_b3>"]
"BID": ["<area>", "<sector_start>", "<program_start_address>", "<ext_csd_b1>", "<ext_csd_b3>"]
```

Each board has a dedicated section for its specific configuration. The available setting types are as follows:

- **General**:
  - ethernet: Specifies the addresses of `ether0` and `ether1` in sequential order.
  - flash_address: The SPI flash address where BL2, FIP, and board information are sequentially stored.
  - load_address: The working RAM address used to load the binary file before writing it to SPI flash.

- **qspi**:
  - BL2: Provide the `srec_top_address` and `flash_address` sequentially for the BL2 image.
  - FIP: Provide the `srec_top_address` and `flash_address` sequentially for the FIP image.
  - BID (Board Identification): Supports two image formats: `.bin` and `.srec`.
    - If using `.bin`: Specify `binary_size` and `flash_address` sequentially.
    - If using `.srec`: Specify `srec_top_address` and `flash_address` sequentially.

- **emmc**:
  - BL2: Specify `area`, `sector_start`, and `program_start_address` sequentially for the BL2 image.
  - FIP: Specify `area`, `sector_start`, `program_start_address`, `ext_csd_b1`, and `ext_csd_b3` sequentially for the FIP image.
  - BID (Board Identification): Provide `area`, `sector_start`, `program_start_address`, `ext_csd_b1`, and `ext_csd_b3` sequentially for the board identification image.
